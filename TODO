Limitations:
- The tests for CA certs against GFD-C.125 are incomplete.
- The tests for EE certs against GFD-C.125 are incomplete.
- The test framework returns OK/NOT OK for individual tests and PASS/FAIL for a test suite. This may not capture the nuances of the Grid Cert Profile or other docs.

From EU Grid PMA meeting - 2009-01:
- Make some tests (SHOULDs, other ambiguous or harmless tests) into warnings
- Create a Crypt::OpenSSL::Req module
