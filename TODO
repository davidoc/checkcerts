Limitations:
- The tests for CA certs against GFD-C.125 are incomplete.
- The tests for EE certs against GFD-C.125 are incomplete.
- The test framework returns OK/NOT OK for individual tests and PASS/FAIL for a test suite. This may not capture the nuances of the Grid Cert Profile or other docs.

From EU Grid PMA meeting - 2009-01:
- Make some tests (SHOULDs, other ambiguous or harmless tests) into warnings
- Create a Crypt::OpenSSL::Req module

Other:
- Better mechanism for defining/including common tests
- Not clear if "TODO" tests are working. 
- Output TAP to CSV?
- Ensure that same number of tests are always run (e.g. include "pass" tests to balance conditional tests)

Using the spreadsheet of implemented tets:
- Add TODO tests
- Add identifiers to all test outputs
- Add manual test placeholders
- Draft GFD-C.125bis ?

Other tests:
- Check for collisions between hash in OpenSSL < 1 and OpenSSL > 1 (-hash, -hash_old)
