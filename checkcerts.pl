=head1 NAME

checkcerts.pl - check certificate profiles

=head1 SYNOPSIS

checkcerts.pl [options] --tests [file ...] --certs [file ...]

Options:

   -a --aggregate   aggregate results for all tests on all certs 

   -h --help        brief help message
   -m --man         full documentation
   -v --verbose     verbose output

Flags:

   --tests          one or more test suite files
   --certs          one or more certificate files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<checkcerts.pl> runs tests against certificates.
The tests can check aspects of a certificate's profile against requirements
or standards.

=cut

my @tests;
my @certs;
my $verbose = 0;
my $all = 0;
my $help = 0;
my $man = 0;

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<-a --aggregate>

Aggregate results of all supplied tests on all supplied certificates in a
single test run.  This will give an overall C<PASS> or C<FAIL> result, which
may be useful to verify compliance of a set of certicates.

By default (when this option is not specified) each combination of test suite
and certificate gets its own test run and an individual result.

=item B<-h --help>  

Print a brief help message and exits.

=item B<-m --man>   

Prints the manual page and exits.

=item B<-v --verbose>

Produce verbose output. In particular, this will give an individual C<ok>
or C<not ok> result for each test within a test file.

=back

=head1 FLAGS

=over 8

=item B<-t --test --tests>

This flag is used to specify one or more test suites
to apply to certificates. The test suites should use the Test::More module,
or equivalent, to provide test results in the correct form. More details
of the tests are given below.

This flag can appear multiple times.

=item B<-c --cert --certs>

This flag is used to specify one or more certificates
to check. Certificates should be in PEM format.

This flag can appear multiple times.

=head1 TESTS

The structure of a test suite is as follows:

    use Test::More qw( no_plan );

    use Crypt::OpenSSL::X509;

    for my $certfile(@ARGV) {
        ok(my $x509 = Crypt::OpenSSL::X509->new_from_file($certfile),
         "new_from_file $certfile");

        cmp_ok($x509->version, '==', 2, 'version');

        # ... more tests
    }

The tests are written using C<ok>, C<like>, and other test functions
described in the documentation for Test::More.

Note that Crypt::OpenSSL::X509 and any other tools used to examine the
certificates must be used within the test suite itself: checkcerts.pl
only provides a test harness for running the test suites.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Check a CA certificate against test suite:

    checkcerts.pl --test gfd125-ca.t --cert cacert.pem

Check all grid CA certificates against test suite:

    checkcerts.pl --test gfd125-ca.t \
    --certs /etc/grid-security/certificates/*.[0-9]

Check all in a single test run to give aggregate result:

    checkcerts.pl --aggregate --test gfd125-ca.t \
    --certs /etc/grid-security/certificates/*.[0-9]

=head1 NOTES

The supplied test suites C<gfd125-ca.t>, C<gfd125-ee.t>, etc. use a pre-release version of
Crypt::OpenSSL::X509 that is not yet widely distributed.  It can be downloaded
from I<http://github.com/davidoc/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/tree/master>.
